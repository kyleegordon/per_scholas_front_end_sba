This is the website for a cyber security consulting company. Users will be able to create an account that captures information about their organization and industry. They will also fill out an assessment with questions based on the 18 CIS Critical Security Controls. This data will used to create a report that assigns them an overall security score and highlights areas that need improvement. It will use this information to recommend services that align with the areas that need improvement.

So far, I have created the Home page, Sign Up page, and Assessment page. JavaScript is used to collect and validate data that is entered in forms on the Sign Up and Assessment pages. It is also used to animate the dropdown navigation menu.
